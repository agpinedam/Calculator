# Calculator
Simple program without graphic interface awaiting for commands, after entering a command should show the result of the operation. 

List of commands:

  Sum X Y <result>
  Minus X Y <result>
  Multiply X Y <result>
  Divide X Y <result>
  Show <result>
  Exit <result>

X and Y are numeric values, but if any of those values is not numeric, should use values stored with that name. If that value doesn't exist must show an error.
<result> is an optional variable used to store the result of operation in the name of this variable. This calculator should store AT LEAST 10 possible variables.
